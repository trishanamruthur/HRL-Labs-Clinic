# Gitlab Documentation

HRL presumably already has Gitlab set up how they want it. This documentation is here so HRL knows how the clinic team set it up, in case that becomes relevant for troubleshooting or figuring out why something behaves differently on HRL's network.

We installed Gitlab Omnibus on a computer running Ubuntu 22.04 following [these instructions](https://about.gitlab.com/install/#ubuntu). We did not use the Gitlab Ultimate, either as a trial or in full.
