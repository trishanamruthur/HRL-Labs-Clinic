HRL's devices then have "plungers" for each of the dots and "gates" to control the barriers adjacent to dots. HRL's current devices have six dots in series with one another, parallel to two sets of single dots that are used for readout, as described in 

# Triple Quantum Dot
## Overview of Triple Quantum Dots
This page will serve as an introduction to triple quantum dots. Devices in exchange-only quantum computing utilize three electrons in three tunnel-coupled quantum dots. Because of many technologies being developed at HRL, such as the SLEDGE device, are designed for triple-dot operations, itâ€™s necessary to have an approachable introduction to such technologies. 

## SLEDGE Device
In this section we will elaborate further on triple quantum dot devices, specifically on SLEDGE devices. Explanations will be based on the [LINK: HAHA] and include discussion on the process flow and how it does triple-dot specific encodings.

## Device Animation
This section will consist of an animated graphic of the SLEDGE device with the gates in motion, as referenced from Figure 1 of the Ha paper. 

## Pairwise Stability Diagrams
In this section we will provide an explanation of pairwise stability diagrams. It will answer more specific questions one may have on these diagrams in relation to triple quantum dots, such as how the loading and presence of 3 electrons in a device is measured and confirmed. 

## Sample Pairwise Stability Diagram
In this section we will place a animated or interactive demo of a pairwise stability diagram. 

## Summary and Reference
We will include a summary of the topic as well as links to the sources referenced in the above sections, as well as other relevant research that can provide additional information for those who want to dig deeper into the topic.
