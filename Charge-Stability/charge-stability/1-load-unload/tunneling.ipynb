    "# Electron Tunneling\n",

    "## Square Potential\n",
    "In Quantum Mechanics, particles can [tunnel](gls:tunneling) through classically forbidden areas where  $E \\leq V.$ The [quantum dot](gls:quantum-dot) works by having potential barriers surrounding the dot. Thus, an electron tunnels through a quantum dot. The T-gates' voltage determines the height of the barrier, and therefore how hard it is for the electron to tunnel into the dot. Thus, the tunneling rate of the electron depends on the T-gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand tunneling, we can begin with a toy example. The dot is in the plunger gate which here has a constant potential $V_P$. The T-gates we simplify having the same constant voltage $V_T$. We further simplify by setting the source and drain potential of the dot having 0 voltage. Below is an equation for the potential around the dot. \n",

    "Then, we can note that the [wave function](gls:wavefxn) of the electron would satisfy [the Schrodinger equation](gls:schrodinger). To understand the procedure of solving the double-wall potential described here, [Townsend](../../../PDFs/Townsend_textbook.pdf) chapter 6.10 does a good job describing the general procedure. We will be following the procedure here. First, we can create a general wave function and solve for the coefficients using the boundary conditions. \n",

    "### Better Approximations, the Fermi-Hubbard Model\n",
    "The WKB approximation is a simple approximation of the tunneling probability. However, the approximation relies on the fact that the potential does not change over time. However, these potentials might change as the voltage of the gates change. Thus, a more sophisticated model is necessary to model the tunneling probability. This is the Fermi-Hubbard Model which deals with particles in 2D or 3D lattices . To find out more about the model, [Esslinger 2010](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.0012.pdf#:~:text=Figure%202%3A%20A%20Hubbard%20model,atom%20of%20a%20different%20spin.) does a good job explaining the basics. \n",
