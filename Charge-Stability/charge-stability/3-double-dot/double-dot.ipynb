In the [Van Der Wiel paper](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/pdf/10.1103/RevModPhys.75.1) they present a classical model of a double quantum dot system shown in [figure 1](vdw-fig1). This model turns out to be quite accurate in demonstrating the key features of this system.\n",

    "A classical model of a double quantum dot presented in the [Van Der Wiel paper](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/pdf/10.1103/RevModPhys.75.1).

Each dot is also coupled to a \"plunger\" that can manipulate the chemical potential of that dot.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the [Van Der Wiel paper](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/pdf/10.1103/RevModPhys.75.1), they develop analytical expressions for the chemical potential $\\mu$ of each dot in terms of the current electron populations, the gate voltages, and the cross capacitances.

Likewise, $E_{C2}$ is the increase in the enenrgy of dot 2 when an electron tunnels into it. Lastly, $E_{Cm}$ is the increase in the energy of one dot when an electron tunnels into the other dot. By defining the chemical potential of the source and drain to be $\\mu=0$, we can understand the behavior of the double dot system using equations {eq}`mu_1` and {eq}`mu_2`. Whenever $\\mu_1 < -E_{C1}$, an electron can (and will) tunnel into dot 1 from the source, while whenever $\\mu_2 < -E_{C2}$, an electron will tunnel into dot 2 from the drain. This will continue until $0<\\mu_1<-E_{C1}$ and $0 < \\mu_2 < E_{C2}$, when neither dot can accept any more electrons. Of course, the only control we have here are the gate voltages for either dot: $V_{g1}$ and $V_{g2}$. By modulating these controls, we can affect the stable configuration of electrons the double dot system."

These diagrams follow directly from the discussion of [charge sensing](../2-sensing-dot/sensing-dot) in the previous section. Figure 3 (TODO: CHECK FIGURE) on that page shows how we can infer dot population from the number of spikes on a plot of $dI/dV$, where $I$ is the current through the dot sensor and $V$ is the voltage of the plunger. When an electron tunnels into the dot, there is an immediate change in the potential of the sensor dot which causes an immediate change to the current $I$ and appears as a sharp peak in the plot of $dI/dV$ vs $V$.\n",

    "## Comparing HRL's Devices to the Van Der Wiel Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously the [Van Der Wiel model](vdw-fig1) is incredibly simplistic, but it does a pretty good job demonstrating key features of placing quantum dots in series with one another. There is however, one huge difference between HRL's devices (as well as similar devices like the one described in [Borselli et al](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-4484/26/37/375202/pdf)): ***HRL's devices do not use resistors between dots***. Instead, electrons trying to pass from one dot to the next must overcome a ***potential barrier*** introduced by a seperate \"gate\" electrode which can also be modulated. See the [next page on multi-dot arrays](../4-qd-arrays/quantum-dot-arrays.md) for further discussion of HRL-specific quantum dot arrays and device operation.\n",

    "## Quantum Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now in a position to discuss some of the oddities of experimental stability diagrams, much of which arise from the quantum nature of the structure that we are dealing with. In particular, the confinement of electrons into quantum dots means that there is a discrete energy spectrum which is available to the electrons [TODO: EXTERNAL RESOURCES?], and so an electron cannot just jump into a dot whenever it has enough energy to do so. In order for an electron to hop into the dot, it must both have _enough energy_ and _there must be an available energy level in the dot_ that the electron can access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the effect of the discrete energy spectrum is relatively minimal on the overall stability diagram, mostly appearing in a smoothing out of the stability lines near triple points.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another effect that is quantum but has more to do with the implementation. As mentioned [above](hrl-vs-vdw) these devices do not actually contain any resistors, instead modulating electron travel with potential barriers. Because of this, as we continue adding higher energy electrons, the electrons we add are less and less confined to staying within their dot. This effect is apparent in [the figure presented by Borselli et al](borselli-fig4) as well as [the figure below](HA-fig4-0) where the lines in the top right of the plots begin to smooth out, as though there were a high mutual capacitance between the dots. In effect that is what it means for the electrons to be less confined: that they have a greater effect on the components around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you should note that in both [the figure from Borselli et al](borselli-fig4) as well as [below](HA-fig4-0), the diagonal lines connecting triple points appear to be non-existent. This is not actually a physical effect so much as a consequence of how the plots were made. In constructing these plots, they swept the mutual plunger voltages $V_1+V_2$, scanning the sensor dot diagonally on the plot. This means that even though there is a jump in current for the sensor dot if you travel across the boundary, this jump was not picked up on by the sweep since the sweep went along the line of where such a jump would be. (TODO: this is poorly explained)\n",

    "## Cross Capacitances\n",
    "\n",
    "There is however, a large physical inaccuracy in the Van Der Weil model: each components is only modeled as being capacitively coupled to _adjacent components_. In reality, every electrode on the device will have some capacitance between itself and every other part of the device. In the schematic shown in [figure 1](vdw-fig1), we might imagine adding capacitors between $V_{g2}$ and $N_2$; $V_{g1}$ and $N_1$; $S$ and $N_2$; and $N_1$ and $D$. The notion of every electrical component having some capacitance with every other electrical component is what is referred to by **cross capacitance**. You can imagine how complicated these cross capacitances get when dealing with the number of electrodes shown in [figure 4](HA-fig1).\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the effect of these cross capacitances, we have visualized some of the effects in an animation below. We show a device much like the one in [figure 4](HA-fig1) but with only a two dots ($P0$ and $P1$), mediated from the source and the drain by three gates ($X0$, $X1$, and $X2$). We then plot on the $z$-axis the electric potential at every point in the semiconductor layer where electrons live and traverse the device. Then, we show the effects as we wiggle some of the gate voltages. This is not a quantatiative plot, but rather a qualitative demonstration of how small changes in any one of the gate voltages really do affect the potential at every single point in the device.
