# Glossary and Resources

(gls:heterostructure)=
## Semiconductor Heterostructure
A heterostructure is a solid in which two distinct materials with different physical and chemical properties are joined together, creating a boundary between the materials where interesting physics can happen. [Read more](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1557/s43577-021-00147-8#Sec2).

(gls:chempot-fermi-e)=
## Chemical Potential / Fermi Level
The amount of energy needed to move a particle (in our case, probably an electron) to a system.

(gls:dot-charge-sensor)=
## Dot Charge Sensor
A 
uantum dot placed near other quantum dots in order to measure 
(gls:qubit)=
## Qubit
A "qubit" can be any two-level quantum system, whose states get labeled $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit).

(gls:bloch-sphere)=
## Bloch Sphere
A Bloch sphere is a visual representation of a qubit. Typically, it is used to visualize a 2-state qubit with states $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere).

At HRL, the Bloch sphere represents 3-spin qubits. To learn more about how qubits are encoded at HRL, [read more here](../../PDFs/Bukard.pdf).

(gls:cap-coupling)=
## Capacitive Coupling
The concept that nearby gates or dots can electrostatically affect othe

(gls:tunneling)=
## Tunneling
Tunneling is a quantum mechanical effect wherein a particle which classically would not be able to traverse some barrier between two regions actually does have a small probability of making it through the barrier.

(gls:energy-quantization)=
## Energy Level Quantization
This refers to the fact that in (bound) quantum mechanical systems, there are discrete energy values that the system can take on, and intermediate energies are not allowed.

(gls:quantum-dot)=
## Quantum Dot
Quantum dots are semiconductor nanoparticles that have varyingg optoelectronic properties depending on its composition.

(gls:lever-arm)=
## Lever Arm
The lever arm $\alpha_{12}$ refers to the infinitesimal ratio $dV_2/dV_1$ for two electrical components. It defines the effect that a small change in $V_1$ will have on $V_2$, namely that $\Delta V_2 = \alpha_{12}\Delta V_1$.

(gls:spin)
## Spin
Spin, or intrinsic angular momentum, is a property of particles at a quantum scale.
