    "# Double Quantum Dots\n",
    "\n",
    "Double quantum dots are a great educational example, so it is worth spending a while thinking about double-dot systems because general multi-dot systems follow quite naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classical Model\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out to be quite relevant to be thinking about double quantum dots in the purely classical regime. In the [Van Der Wiel paper](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/pdf/10.1103/RevModPhys.75.1) they present a classical model of a double quantum dot system shown in [figure 1](vdw-fig1).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ./VDW-fig1.png\n",

    "A classical model of a double quantum dot presented in the [Van Der Wiel paper](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/pdf/10.1103/RevModPhys.75.1). The dots are coupled to sources, drains, and each other through a resistor and capacitor in parallel.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, this model simplifies things a _lot_, and is not entirely realistic to the devices that HRL uses [(see comparison)](hrl-vs-vdw), but is still a great way to discuss some of the tools used to understand the operation of these devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [Van Der Wiel paper](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/pdf/10.1103/RevModPhys.75.1), they develop analytical expressions for the chemical potential $\\mu$ of each dot in terms of the current electron populations, the gate voltages, and the cross capacitances. These equations are {eq}`mu_1` and {eq}`mu_2`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: mu_1\n",
    "\\mu_1 = \\left(N_2-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)E_{C2} + N_1E_{Cm} - \\frac{1}{|e|}\\left(C_{g1}V_{g1}E_{Cm} + C_{g2}V_{g2}E_{Cm}\\right)\n",
    "```\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: mu_2\n",
    "\\mu_2 = \\left(N_2-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)E_{C2} + N_1E_{Cm} - \\frac{1}{|e|}\\left(C_{g1}V_{g1}E_{Cm} + C_{g2}V_{g2}E_{Cm}\\right)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the energy $E_{C1}$ is the increase in the chemical potential dot 1 when an electron tunnels into it. Likewise, $E_{C2}$ is the increase in the chemical potential of dot 2 when an electron tunnels into it. Lastly, $E_{Cm}$ is the increase in the chemical potential of dot one dot when an electron tunnels into the other dot. By defining the chemical potential of the source and drain to be $\\mu=0$, we can understand the behavior of the double dot system using equations {eq}`mu_1` and {eq}`mu_2`. Whenever $\\mu_1 < -E_{C1}$, an electron can (and will) tunnel into dot 1 from the source, while whenever $\\mu_2 < -E_{C2}$, an electron will tunnel into dot 2 from the drain. This will continue until $0<\\mu_1<-E_{C1}$ and $0 < \\mu_2 < E_{C2}$. Of course, the only control we have here are the gate voltages for either dot: $V_{g1}$ and $V_{g2}$, and by modulating these controls, we can affect the stable population of electrons in either dot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stability Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a great way to visualize how the voltages $V_{g1}$ and $V_{g2}$ affect the stable populations of the dots: through **stability diagrams**. These diagrams can be a bit hard to interpret so we'll look at the first one together."

    "## Quantum Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "The confinement of electrons into quantum dots means that in reality, and electron cannot just jump into a dot whenever it has enough energy to do so. Quantum dots have a discrete spectrum of allowed energy levels, and so in order for an electron to hop into the dot, it must both have enough energy _and_ there must be an available energy level in the dot for the electron to jump into.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the effect of having discrete energy levels like this within the dot does not affect most of the understanding of stability diagrams that we have been building. These effects mostly appear in the **smoothing out** of the hexagons particularly around the diagonal intersections between $(n,m)$ and $(n+1,m+1)$ configurations, as well as the fuzziness of those diagonal connections in general. These effects are most apparent with a [TODO: LARGER/SMALLER ???] number of electrons in the dots.\n",

    "Unlike the model shown in [figure 1](vdw-fig1), HRL's devices _do not use  resistors between dots_. Instead, electrons trying to pass from one dot to the next must overcome a _potential barrier_ which can be raised or lowered by a seperate gate voltage. Furthermore, HRL's devices have more quantum dots in series with each other as well as dots in parallel to those to allow for readout, this process is detailed on the next page [TODO: HOW DOES READOUT HAPPEN].\n",

    "## Cross Capacitances\n",
    "\n",
    "There is however, a large physical inaccuracy in the Van Der Weil model: each components is only modeled as being capacitively coupled to _adjacent components_. In reality, every electrode on the device will have some capacitance between itself and every other part of the device. In the schematic shown in [figure 1](vdw-fig1), we might imagine adding capacitors between $V_{g2}$ and $N_2$; $V_{g1}$ and $N_1$; $S$ and $N_2$; and $N_1$ and $D$. The notion of every electrical component having some capacitance with every other electrical component is what is referred to by **cross capacitance**. You can imagine how complicated these cross capacitances get when dealing with the number of electrodes shown in [figure 4](HA-fig1).\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the effect of these cross capacitances, we have visualized some of the effects in an animation below. We show a device much like the one in [figure 4](HA-fig1) but with only a two dots ($P0$ and $P1$), mediated from the source and the drain by three gates ($X0$, $X1$, and $X2$). We then plot on the $z$-axis the electric potential at every point in the semiconductor layer where electrons live and traverse the device. Then, we show the effects as we wiggle some of the gate voltages. This is not a quantatiative plot, but rather a qualitative demonstration of how small changes in any one of the gate voltages really do affect the potential at every single point in the device.
