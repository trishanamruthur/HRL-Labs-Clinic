    "## Electron Tunneling\n",
    "Our explaination will mainly focus on the mathematics of a single quantum dot detailed in [JP Dodson's thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WwClMsCgio_W2kMsU0MmD7fbYPvzaK7f/view?usp=sharing). We will explain how the M1 gate determines the chemical potential of the dot. We will then explain how different chemical potentials lead to tunneling between the source and drain. We will explain the M2 plot in Dodson Figure 2.4c. \n",

    "Next, we will explain how the T gates control the tunneling rates of the electron. We will explain Figure 2.4b in Dodson's thesis. We will try to find an equation that relates the voltages of the T gates to the tunneling rates. "

We will give some equations on the dependence of tunneling probability on temperature and difference in energy between the source and the first unoccupied state in the dot, incorporating a temperature slider in the subsequent animation if feasible."
