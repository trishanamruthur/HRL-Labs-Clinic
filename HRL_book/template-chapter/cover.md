# Template Chapter Cover Page

This is the cover page for the chapter, it can introduce the topic and give some background or overview of topics to come.

One important thing to note is that (in general) you'll want the cover page to build the table of contents like so:

```{tableofcontents}

```

This ensures that the table of content for the pages within this chapter will build correctly at the top-level.
