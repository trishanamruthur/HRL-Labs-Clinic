This review explores the physics of semiconductor spin qubits, emphasizing achievements and recent advances in GaAs, Si, and Ge spin qubits. The focus includes spin initialization, control, readout in quantum dots, exchange interactions, impact of noise, and efforts to hybridize spin qubits with superconducting systems, providing insights into the future prospects of scalable solid-state quantum information processing.

[Crowley](../../PDFs/crowley_2008.pdf)
This paper investigates the forces acting on a charged conducting particle in proximity to a conducting plane. It explores the dependence of the force on factors such as net charge, separation, and particle size, distinguishing between scenarios of constant charge and constant potential. The study presents complex exact formulas for these forces but offers more practical and simplified expressions that approximate the results with high accuracy, comparing them to less accurate earlier approximations.

[Davies](../../PDFs/Davies.pdf)
The study presents analytical calculations of the potential in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) generated by patterned polygon gates on a heterostructure surface, considering bare and screened potentials with different boundary conditions. The formulas allow for the determination of threshold voltages, estimation of the 2DEG region, and analysis of collective infra-red excitations, emphasizing the impact of exposed surface behavior and the importance of accurate modeling with a thorough understanding of surface states.

The Fermi-Hubbard model, crucial in condensed matter physics for understanding electronic and magnetic properties, has been experimentally realized using a fermionic quantum gas in an optical lattice. This atomic approach allows for the simulation of the Hamiltonian, derived from optical lattice potentials, offering insights into d-wave superconductivity and quantum magnetism in various regimes such as metallic, band-insulating, superfluid, and Mott-insulating.

This paper presents the current state-of-the-art design and fabrication process, SLEDGE.

[Hanson](../../PDFs/Hanson.pdf)
This review explores experiments conducted on quantum dots, nanometer-scale boxes in a semiconductor host material, providing precise control over individual electrons and their quantum properties. The focus is on the physics of spins in quantum dots containing one or two electrons, covering experimental methods for extracting spin properties, techniques for manipulating individual spin states, and the exploration of relevant relaxation and dephasing mechanisms, with direct implications for quantum information processing and single spintronics.

[Illera et al](../../PDFs/illera&al_2015.pdf)
The paper presents a model for simulating electron transport through a random distribution of interacting quantum dots in a dielectric matrix, aiming to capture the characteristics of realistic devices. The model, based on the Transfer Hamiltonian approach, incorporates fundamental parameters, noncoherent rate equations, and interactions between quantum dots and electrodes through transition rates and capacitive couplings, providing insights into prototypical devices like an array of quantum dots in a matrix insulator and a transistor device based on quantum dots.

[VanDerWiel](../../PDFs/VanDerWiel.pdf)
The review examines electron transport experiments on two lateral quantum dots coupled in series, focusing on the charge stability diagram and electrochemical potentials. Resonant tunneling experiments and microwave spectroscopy are employed to accurately determine intrinsic lifetimes of discrete energy states and probe the transition from ionic to covalent bonding, respectively, in the context of double quantum dot studies relevant for solid-state quantum bit realization.
