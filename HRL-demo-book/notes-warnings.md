# Notes/Warnings Demo
This is a small sample of how we would embed notes and warnings to make the notebook more interactive. This could be used to make sure the user has the correct prior knowledge berfore reading a page, or links to further reading. 


```{note}
Possible notes
```

```{warning}
Possible warning message
```

We can also create our own tips/notes:

```{admonition} Read Next
Link

```

`````{admonition} Further Reading on this topic
